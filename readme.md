# AWSkids  
**Serverless Certificate Generation using AWS Lambda & API Gateway**

AWSkids is a serverless backend application built on **AWS Lambda** and **API Gateway** that generates completion certificates for educational use cases. The project demonstrates event-driven cloud architecture, API design, and backend automation using managed AWS services.

---

## Core Functionality

- HTTP-triggered certificate generation via **AWS API Gateway**
- Stateless backend processing using **AWS Lambda (Node.js)**
- Dynamic request handling (e.g., participant name, completion status)
- Designed for low-latency, scalable execution without server management

---

## Architecture

- Fully serverless, pay-per-execution model
- No persistent infrastructure required

This architecture highlights:
- Event-driven system design
- Cloud scalability and cost efficiency
- Separation of concerns between frontend input and backend processing

---

## Technology Stack

- **AWS Lambda** – serverless compute
- **AWS API Gateway** – RESTful API endpoint
- **Node.js (JavaScript)** – backend runtime
- **AWS Cloud Infrastructure**

---

## Use Case

Built for educational workflows such as:
- Generating completion certificates for students
- Supporting lightweight learning applications
- Automating backend logic without dedicated servers

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Serverless application development
- AWS Lambda & API Gateway integration
- REST API design
- Event-driven backend architecture
- Cloud-native system design
- JavaScript backend development

---

## Potential Extensions

- PDF certificate generation
- Certificate storage using **Amazon S3**
- Email delivery via **AWS SES**
- Authentication and access control

---

## Project Context

This project was developed early in my cloud computing experience as a focused exploration of **AWS serverless technologies**. It laid the foundation for later projects involving more complex cloud workflows, storage systems, and frontend integration.
